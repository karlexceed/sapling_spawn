Sapling Spawn
=====
A mod that makes trees spread out and become dense forests over time.

Saplings will only spawn on well-lit soil blocks with trees close by. The sapling will be the same species as a random nearby tree.

Since this mod uses an ABM, the sapling spawning will only happen in map chunks that are active. As a result, areas that are uninhabited will remain unchanged, but active areas will feel even more dynamic and alive.

I spent a lot of time trying to balance the growth rate and maximum tree density. My goal is that it would be noticeable over time, but not so aggressive that it chokes the landscape in just a few days.

**Current compatibility:**

* Luanti/Minetest Default mod - Fully compatible
* Moretrees mod - Fully compatible
* Ethereal mod - Mostly compatible
* Everness mod - Mostly compatible

Note: If a tree species is not compatible with Sapling Spawn, those species will simply not spawn saplings.
